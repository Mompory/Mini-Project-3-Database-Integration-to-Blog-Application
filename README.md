# Mini-Project-3-Database-Integration-to-Blog-Application
This project is an extension of the work I completed in Mini-Project-1, where I built a basic blog application using Node.js, Express, and EJS. In Mini-Project-3, 
I integrated a PostgreSQL database to allow for persistent data storage, including user authentication, blog post creation, editing, and deletion.
